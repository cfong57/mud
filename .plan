I can help other dev-coders when they have problems, if you have a question feel
free to ask. I am not always able to solve the problem completely but usually I 
can Point You in the Right Direction, and that's a Good Thing(tm).

If you need a tpyochecker, I'm available; just don't expect quick results.

-Contributed to Quiz/Trivia Event (w/ Dyaros; code credits to Tumi though)
