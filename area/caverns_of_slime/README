README FILE FOR AREA: Caverns of Slime. *REVAMPED*
CREATED BY: Allanon.
WITH MAJOR HELP FROM: Echcua and Misrobo.
COMPLETED ON: 12-13-04.

GENERAL THEME: A smallish area of caves, rich in exp and cash. Mobs inside 
include some spirits and shades (undeads), flans, slimes, oozes (acid element 
monsters), Nether Bats/Bluefire Bats, and most importantly the "King Slime" mob.
"King" mob of the area is a huge Slime - has a gloweq. Flans are easy enough for 
any noob to kill. Slimes are more difficult, and Oozes are the hardest. 
Spirit's hardness varies randomly. Shades are tough, and are meant more as the 
kind of monster that you kill for exp with a party, because soling them is too
much effort for the reward. "King" mob takes cooperation of a few lv. 25
and ups (several runs) or to solo takes lv. 35 at the very least (also several 
runs; estimates are probably very flawed). This area has 2 quests and one secret 
quest. There is one (1) SECRET ROOM. Hard to find, and it contains an elven 
ranger monster (HIGHBIE MOB).

BACKGROUND: One day an alchemist who was fascinated with the monsters called 
Puddings decided to run an experiment on them. Normally this would be harmless,
except this time the alchemist added one too many blackslice. The whole thing
blew up, taking out the alchemist, her laboratory, and a 50-foot clearing of 
forest. The Puddings were somehow transformed by the experiment and now run 
wild in the caves under the site of the late alchemist's home. Travelers and
adventurers who have gone to investigate have never returned. Reports from 
Rangers passing by the area told of "large pools of ooze" and "trees that 
have been melted away". When a company of Vaerlon's finest soldiers was sent,
only one, a low-ranking private, returned. While he lay dying in the Temple 
of Air, he kept babbling "A giant black blob sucked up Sarge!". He passed 
away a few days later, and everyone was still miffed as to what had happened
to the doomed company. Reckless adventurers are advised to stay away from 
the area.

LOCATION: Somewhere in the forests south and west of Vaerlon, about 10 tiles 
off the main road. A path leads to it off the main road.

LIST OF MOBILES:

1) Restless shade of a soldier

This vaguely humanoid shade is surrounded by smoky fog that makes it hard to 
perceive. Pale green in color, it seems to be very agitated. Glowering yellow 
eyes shine malevolently on what you suppose is its head. You think it is 
probably the spirit from one of the many skeletons lying around. It drifts 
randomly, occasionally passing through walls and other solid objects. While it 
does not appear particularly dangerous, its weapons and armor look very 
corporeal, and it would be prudent to leave the shade alone.

30k or thereabouts exp. Undead so +resistances. No dropped coins.

2) Wandering, vaguely humanoid spirit

A strange spirit seems to be wandering at random around the caverns. It looks 
like a human at first glance, but its outline is too obscure to be sure. You'd 
guess that this is probably all that remains of one of the numerous adventurers 
who were foolish enough to venture here.

Since the level, size, and equipments of this mobile are random, it has a 
varying exp worth (at least 10k always). Undead so +resistances.

3) Small flan

Before you is a smallish glob of orange ooze. It wiggles and slides around 
slowly, leaving a trail of sticky slime behind it. You can detect no visible 
arms on it, and you wonder how it manages to survive. Then you notice that its 
jellylike body can be transformed into any shape it desires, including tiny arms
or legs. It has two small, black eyelike slits that you can distinguish from the
rest of its body.

The smallest mobile in the Slime family. Worth approximately 500. Drops some 
coins. Resistant to acid damage, has a weak acid special hit.

4) Large orange slime

Before you is a large glob of orange ooze. It wiggles and slides around slowly, 
leaving a trail of sticky slime behind it. You can detect no visible arms on it,
and you wonder how it manages to survive. Then you notice that its jellylike 
body can be transformed into any shape it desires, including tiny arms or legs. 
It has two large, black eyelike slits that you can distinguish from the rest of 
its body.

Worth about 3k. These are one step up from Flans. Drops some coins. Resistant to
acid damage and has an acid special hit (both stronger than the Flan's).

5) Bloated, green ooze

Before you is a large glob of green ooze. It wiggles and slides around slowly, 
leaving a trail of sticky slime behind it. You can detect no visible arms on it,
and you wonder how it manages to survive. Then you notice that its jellylike 
body can be transformed into any shape it desires, including tiny arms or legs.
It has two large, black eyelike slits that you can distinguish from the rest of 
its body.

Worth about 5k. These are one step up from Slimes. Drops some coins. 
Resistant to acid damage and has an acid special hit (both stronger than the 
Slime's).

5) Nether Bats -OR- Bluefire Bats

Bluefire bat, covered in freezing fire / Nether bat, covered in scorching flames

This monster is a distant cousin of the common cave bat. A genetic mutation has 
given them the peculiar ability to resist fire, enough so that they are 
constantly aflame. Flaring red eyes and teeth sharper than stilletos give it a 
quite fearsome appearance. It constantly drips fire as it flies around, and you 
are glad that it is confined to this cave - it would cause untold ruin if let 
loose in the wild.

This monster is a distant cousin of the common cave bat. A genetic mutation has 
given them the peculiar ability to resist ice, enough so that they are 
constantly engulfed in freezing blue flames. Cold, icy-blue eyes and teeth 
sharper than stilletos give it a quite fearsome appearance. A chill wind akin to
that of death seems to follow in its wake.

Basically elemetally-charged bat monsters. Nether Bats are fire, Bluefire Bats 
are ice. Note that at sunset, Nether Bats transform to Bluefire Bats, and at 
sunrise, Bluefire Bats transform to Nether Bats. Worth of about 10k, undead. 
Nether Bats have resistances so that they get healed from fire and take more 
damage from ice, vice versa for the Bluefire Bats. Has some special bonuses for
skins related to elemental charge (yes, skinnable undead).

6) The King Slime

A huge blob of black ooze sits before you. It lets off a disgusting odor, and 
glue-like mucus pools around it. An enormous eyeball, the size of a dinner 
plate, stares at you from deep within the semitransparent blob. The slime's size
has enabled it to form permanent bodyparts: you spot eight tentacle-like arms
and some odd pipe-like appendages. Something golden glints within the blob.

Worth varies a bit but is about 50k. Immune to acid damage. Has an acid special
hit much stronger than the Green Slime's. Drops some coins. This monster is 
special because it is a 'quest monster' - you must slay it to finish either of
the minor quests in this area, since it drops the quest item. This monster also
drops a gloweq when slain. Aggressive. +2500 hpmax. Eight "natural weapons".

7) Furious spirit of a ranger

A clearly spiteful spirit bars your path. You aren't quite sure why it has come 
back from the grave, but it seems to be extremely displeased with something. You
recall that disturbing graves is a good way to incite spirits. You can discern 
from first glance that the spirit is that of a human, and with its two blades it
was definitely also a ranger when alive. A bright silvery wound in its chest 
marks how it died...you think you can still see a fragment of a shattered dagger
embedded within it.

Aggressive undead which serves as a blocker to certain room. Worth of about 25k.
+Resistances because undead. Drops some coins. Drops a diamond shard. Wields a 
random sabre, a random small sword, a random hauberk, random helmet, and random 
gloves.

LIST OF NPCs:

1) lucid ghost of the alchemist
Before you floats the pale white ghost of the alchemist. She seems perturbed by 
something. You seem to recall that the reason spirits are not allowed to leave 
for the Nether Plane is because they have unfinished business in the world...you
wonder if perhaps you could help out?

Worth of about 50k. Has a rather strong Acid Blast spell, so quite dangerous to
kill. Well, it IS a quest monster and all. Undead, +resistances, no coins. Drops
nothing. If you give the quest item to her she will give you the quest reward 
and then disappear. A once-per-boot monster (and therefore quest). Has some
Inquiries.

2) Murin, a tough elven ranger

This ranger, garbed in simple, forest-green clothing, is a young elf female -
she looks to be maybe 120 or so. Her jade-green eyes and shining, pale blond
hair lend an air of youthfulness, and she appears quite beautiful. You sense
that she will grow to be a well-formed elf female in later years. Her
graceful, powerful movements are characteristic of an experienced ranger.
She is an elf and medium of size.

Worth of 170k or so. Of course, you're not really supposed to kill her unless 
highbie. If you give the quest item to you she gives alternate quest reward, but
does not disappear...simply does not give out reward again (until reset). A
once-per-boot monster. Murin has Inquiries. Lots of appropriate Ranger skills.

3) Tourne, experienced-looking spelunker

This dark elf seems to be an expert in the area of cave exploration. You can 
automatically assume, then, that he is also a treasure seeker. His tall frame is
flexible and muscled from years of spelunking. You think that he might have 
chosen his career, not because he liked it, but because it would never require 
exposure to harmful sunlight. You note that spelunkers often make decent 
livings, and their trade isn't exactly seen as dubious by society - a win-win 
situation all around. You notice, with some curiosity, that he seems to be a 
well-educated dark elf...whatever drove him off the path of the scholar, you 
will never know.

Dark elf NPC with some Inquirys. Offers some (somewhat cryptic) hints about the
area. Worth of about 13k. Drops a Metalbit. Wields a random sabre, wears a 
random hauberk.


4) Raban, a shifty-looking thief

You immediately check your belongings again after eyeing this shifty-looking 
human. He looks able to steal just about anything...he's probably here on some 
shady treasure-seeking venture. No doubt his appearance adds greatly to his 
occupation - small, mousy, and furtive. His oily black hair has been grown out 
far enough to serve as a sufficient eyeshade - it covers his right eye, leaving 
the left one to stare you down silently. It is steel grey, and totally 
unreadable...

Human NPC with some Inquirys. He's mostly just here to flesh out the area...
Wields a random rapier and knife, and wears a random robe and cape.


5) Dorrah, riled-looking graverobber

An angry little leprechaun female stands defiantly before you. She seems 
determined to block your passage, for reasons unknown to you. Drool escapes her 
quivering jaws and her eyes betray madness...you wonder how she even manages to 
make a decent living with that sort of appearance. While she looks harmless 
enough in this mental state, you take note that she has an unsheathed blade 
ready at hand. It probably would be wise to leave her alone to her insanity.

Insane Leprechaun NPC. Mildly amusing. Serves as a blocker to certain room.
Offers a BIG hint in an indiscreet way about the area. Wields a random dagger 
and 1 random armour.


LIST OF EQUIPMENTS AND ITEMS:

1) The quest rewards from Ghost

Brilliant purple battleaxe <intense red glow>
Fine steel poorQ battleaxe, deals acid damage "3"

This battleaxe has been painted a brilliant metallic purple. It is 
double-headed, with acid-covered edges on both ends. The shaft goes past the 
head and narrows to a sharp point. The axe feels well balanced and is deadly 
sharp.

Brilliant purple longsword <intense red glow>
Fine steel poorQ longsword, deals acid damage "3"

This longsword has been painted a brilliant metallic purple. Both of its edges 
drip with acid. The blade narrows to a broad but sharp point. The grip of the 
weapon is firm, and it feels well balanced. It looks deadly sharp.

Brilliant purple rapier <intense red glow>
Fine steel poorQ rapier, deals acid damage "3"

This rapier has been painted a brilliant metallic purple. The entire blade drips
with acid. It narrows to an extremely sharp point. A hand guard above the hilt
protects the hand when thrusting. The tip looks deadly sharp.

All 3 sell for about 35k (estimate).

2) The quest reward from Murin

Ancient steel sabre <intense yellow glow>
Steel averageQ sabre, +1damagedexspeed

It's an old sabre, passed down for generations. A tacky leather strip has been w
ound around the handle to provide a grip. There is a luminescent blue gem in the
handle, reminding you of the ocean. The blade has been honed to a fine edge.

Worth about 50k (estimate).

3) Gloweq dropped by King Slime

Slimy black breastplate <intense purple glow>
PoorQ chitisilk bplate, +1dex +5 acid res

This was once a simple breastplate made of chitinium silk, but after being stuck
within the slime for so long it has turned sickly black and is permanently 
covered in a thin coating of slime. However, it still functions fine as an 
armor, and you think it has picked up some magical properties over time.

Sells for about 20k (estimate).

4) THE quest item

The Heart of Gold

This is a very lifelike replica of a human heart, done in gold. It shimmers 
mystically in the light, but other than that it seems perfectly ordinary.

Sells for about 10k.

Give to either Ghost or Murin to finish the minor quests.

5) Shade equipment

Shades wield ordinary steel small shield, steel shortsword, iron chain
mail cuirass, helmet, and gauntlets.

6) Spirits wield totally random armour and weapons.

6) Murin's equipment

Murin wields some rather EXTREME stuff.

Wicked black scimitar <intense pink glow> 
Fine steel, "1" psionic and sonic damage + 1 psionic resist, "1" poison damage.

This curved sword has a pure black blade. A simple crossguard adorned with an 
old elven family crest protects the wielder's hands. There is an evil-looking 
blood ruby embedded in the handle that seems to be giving off some psychic 
emations. The distinct smell of poison is easily detectable from the 
blade...best to be cautious with it.

Tainted black scimitar <intense pink glow>
Fine steel, "1" fire damage + 1 fire resist, "1" speed, "1" accuracy.

This curved sword has a pure black blade. A simple crossguard adorned with an 
old elven family crest protects the wielder's hands. There is a foul-looking 
emerald embedded in the handle. Occasionally the blade bursts into flames, 
leaving an acrid smell of burnt metal in the air. An aura of tainted power 
surrounds the weapon.

The shirt of Stealth <intense green glow> 
Chitinium silk, +1strdexcha

This shirt is made of high-quality demonhide, and is colored in a way which 
makes hiding in the shadows easy. The buttons are made of fine mahogeny wood, 
the likes of which not even the highest nobles have at their disposal. You think
they probably came straight from the tree itself.

Forest-green gloves <intense green glow>
Chitinium silk, +1strdex

These gloves are made of very fine silk, and are as green as the forest itself. 
Lifelike golden leaf adornments are embroidered on the back of each glove. The 
front of the gloves are covered in a peculiar substance similar to tree sap 
which gives them a very good grip.

Forest-green tights <intense green glow>
Chitinium silk, +2dex

These tights are made of very fine silk, and are as green as the forest itself. 
Lifelike golden leaf adornments are embroidered along the outside of the legs. 
This is distinctly a Ranger item, and a wealthy Ranger at that.

Forest-green boots <intense green glow>
Leather boots, +2str

These boots are made of very fine leather, and are as green as the forest 
itself. Lifelike golden leaf adornments are embroidered on each boot. The soles 
are made of well-worn leather which makes no sound. It's quite obvious that a 
wealthy Ranger once owned these.

7) Items obtained through searching Murin's hidden abode

Short bone knife <intense green glow>
Bone knife, +2 leatherworking

The blade may be made of bone, but it looks as sharp as any metal knife you have
seem. It cuts with ease through even tough leather. Aside from its unusual 
sharpness, you can find nothing out of the ordinary with this weapon. A single 
rune graces the hilt.

Shining silver dagger <intense magenta glow>
Silver dagger, "1" poison damage, +1poison resistance, chance to poison enemy

It's a fairly ordinary silver dagger. Poison has been enchanted into the weapon,
causing slight black tarnishes. Seeing as it is made of fine silver and not some
other, better material, you can guess with good reason that it is a weapon of 
the nobles, more for its showy effect than for its usefulness as a real weapon.

8) Fake keys

Throughout the area are scattered 3 keys (Red, Blue, and Green). They are fake 
and do absolutely nothing except confound the mortals.

9) Warning note

Small scrap of parchment

A note written in blood!...Beware the Ranger's remains!...

Small tidbit item I added so a player might, just might, not be slaughtered 
unawares by aggro ranger spirit. Besides that it fleshes out the area nicely.

10) Another Quest Item

Diamond shard

This is an extremely thin, small, and sharp shard. It is made of diamond, which 
is strange since you're almost certain that diamonds never grow to this shape 
naturally. Perhaps it was once part of a weapon, which has shattered. You 
suppose if you had enough shards, you just might be able to fix the weapon.

Get one hundred (yes, you heard me, 100) of these, "fix shards", you get:

11) Diamond Dagger

Brilliantly shining diamond dagger <intense red glow>
Diamond dagger, averageQ, +2damage, +2speed, +1accuracy.

This dagger seems to have been recently reforged from several shards of diamond,
but the quality is so exquisite that you can detect no telltale signs of damage.
The light reflects in arcs of luminescence off the diamond blade, giving it an 
aura of brilliance. The blade has been honed to deadly sharpness, and the tip is
finer than that of a pin.

Yes this item is INSANELY good and Yes its worth is extraordinary. But! Just
think about it for a moment...collect ONE HUNDRED shards?! That's at least 10
reboots we're talking about here. Besides, no hints for the quest...

12) The Real Key Etc.

Searcing in the "pool" rooms will give you an item:

Small metal bit

When you get 4 of these, "combine bits" to make:

Small steel key <eerie glow>

...which can be used to unlock the door leading to the lair of the King Slime.
Yes, this is the "real" key. :)

LISTING OF ROOMS:
