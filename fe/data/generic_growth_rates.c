//generic_growth_rates.c
//database of the growth rates for generic enemies
//even the recruitable character-specific classes have data here...just in case
//we ever wanted to make enemies of them
//also, as far as I'm aware, every generic enemy in the game is male (for
//classes that support both genders), so I assume they all use the male growth
//rates...not that they are significantly different anyway
//note: fe7 doesn't have data for female versions of some classes, so I'm
//adding those in using fe8 data
