"Eliwood: Hm. You expected otherwise?\n",
"Hector: No, of course not. I knew you’d be fine.\n",
"Eliwood: Hector, wait for a moment. What did you want?\n",
"Hector: Nothing. It’s enough to see that you live and are still fighting. "+
"Just wanted to make sure you weren’t overdoing it with me not around.\n",
"Eliwood: I should say the same to you.\n",
"Hector: Me? Don’t worry about me. I’m fine. I’m built tough, you know. A "+
"little too much is just enough for me. But you, you’ve never a hardy one, "+
"Eliwood. Nor are you used to travel. Go on too long and you’ll collapse.\n",
"Eliwood: We’re all weaklings compared to you, Hector. ...Thankfully, wars "+
"are not won by strength alone, eh? We’ve been sparring once every two months 
"since we were twelve, and of 30 matches, 14 I won, 12 I lost, and 4 were "+

"Hector: Erh? I think not! I recall 31 matches--an even 13-13 split, with 5 "+
"draws!\n",

"Hector: Hmph. And what makes you so certain?\n",
"Eliwood: Whose snoring was it that shook the rafters in number class?\n",
"Hector: Ah, good point.\n",
"Eliwood: ...Still, I’m touched you were worried about me. Now, back to the "+

"Eliwood: Something wrong, Hector? Was that a yawn I saw? Not the best "+

"Eliwood: Dreams? What kind of dreams?\n",
"Hector: Laugh, and I’ll kill you.\n",
"Eliwood: ...All right.\n",
"Hector: There was this man--a giant with a great beard--carrying a girl on "+
"his shoulders. The girl called to him “Father”, and she was smiling, happy. "+
"Then the father said to her, “Yes, my beloved daughter?” That’s all, really. "+
"But it felt as though... It felt like a long-past memory. The man looked a "+
"bit like my own father, I suppose. But who is the little girl? Aye, she was "+
"a cute one.\n",
"Eliwood: What color was her hair?\n",
"Hector: Huh. Blue.\n",
"Eliwood: And the man’s hair? His moustache?\n",
"Hector: His were bluish, too.\n",
"Eliwood: Then it is a vision of your own future! A great moustache, eh? "+
"Ah hah hah!\n",
"Hector: Grr... You laughed! Hm. If that is my future I’m not sure I like "+
"it.\n",
"Eliwood: Why not?\n",
"Hector: The girl that would be my daughter... She gets taken away by this "+
"boy that appears later. ...A boy with red hair! Yes, it was red, I’m sure of "+
"it.\n",
"Eliwood: Don’t get ahead of yourself! There are plenty of people with red "+
"hair...\n",
"Hector: Quiet! Now I’m sure-- the boy was a Pheraen. No matter how close we "+

"Eliwood: Hector, you still remember that time?\n",
"Hector: What time?\n",
"Eliwood: You know, what was it-- ten years ago? When the lords of Lycia held "+
"the oath rites, back in Ostia? \"Should one land of Lycia be attacked, all "+
"will fight as one...\" Remember? While our parents were off pledging their "+
"oaths, we kids were in that one room.\n",
"Hector: Yeah, I remember. We had to act in a manner befitting the children "+
"of nobility, or some such nonsense. I just remember being stuck in there, "+
"having to sit in that chair talking to whoever was next to me. Course, "+
"wouldn’t you know that Erik of Laus was on my right? Man, I heard more than "+
"enough sweet talk from that one!\n",
"Eliwood: Right, right. That was the first time any of us met, after all. He "+
"had no idea who you were-- he just wanted to get in favor with a lordling "+
"of Lycia.\n",
"Hector: Aye, he was all mouth anyway. Saying things like \"let us join "+
"forces for the good of Lycia\", and such... then running when things turned "+
"sour.\n",
"Eliwood: Aw, don’t be too hard on him. When he jumped up, yelling about us "+
"swearing our own oaths, then cut his hand like that... No one else knew what "+
"to do, either.\n",
"Hector: Well, everyone’s heard the stories. They all know it’s the warriors’ "+
"custom. Each cuts his own hands, then shakes hands with his brothers... What "+
"man wouldn’t want to do that? Only one had the guts to meet him, though.\n",
"Eliwood: ...You know, back then, I’m proud I took your hand. We are friends, "+
"sharing a life-dream now, an ambition. When one is in danger, the other "+
"risks his life to protect him... That’s why you came, isn’t it? Because you "+
"remembered?\n",
"Hector: Heh, I’ve got no plans to break my oath. Not now, not ever.\n",
"Eliwood: Likewise.\n",
"Hector: Well, then let’s live long and in health! I don’t want to hear any "+
"excuses about not being able to come help when we’re old men.\n",
"Eliwood: It’s a deal. ...Stay alive, Hector.\n",
"Hector: Deal. And don’t you go dying before me, either. I’d never forgive "+
