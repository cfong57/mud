GENERAL THEME: 
Area is a forest + lumberjack camp, with goblin lumberjacks, hence the name. 
There is also a third section connected to the forest which has some secret
stuff in it, and is hard to reach unless a player is very observant and patient.
Treants populate the forest and are 'at war' with lumberjacks. They are led by 
a dryad, and the goblins are led by a derro. The area should be suitable 
for mid-level players, the smallest mob is worth about 4k and the biggest 
topping out at around 50k. Area consists of 30 rooms, with about 1/3 to each.
section of the area - the goblin camp, the forest, and "secret stuff". There are 
two basic quests, to help either side of the war, treants or goblins. In
addition, there is a somewhat difficult (well, in terms of thinking required)
quest to help a hidden monster finish their research. To fit in with the lore of 
the area, it should ideally be placed somewhere in a forest,
since where else would one cut down trees?

BACKGROUND:
The Graemor Logging Company is not a particularly well-known or respected
establishment; they have been known for some rather destructive environmental
practices, and were long ago declared unaffiliated with the kingdom of Graemor 
due to rising complaints from the Rangers, Gaesati Shapeshifters, and even 
the local Wilders. As a result they have had to venture farther and farther 
afield to find work and trees. Recently the latest expedition decided that a 
certain old forest near <city> was an ideal location. Known to locals as the 
Chromatic Forest because of the beautiful foliage that is said to shift with
the elemental phase, it is a sacred place where the trees themselves have 
been seen to move. It also happened to be the rumored hideout of a legendary
elf mage, but no one has been able to confirm or deny such a thing.

The derro overseer of the Company, along with a pack of goblin workers and 
some supplies, was sent to scout the area in advance of the main crew and to get 
permanently established logging underway. Things went smoothly, but soon the 
goblins encountered trouble when the dryad protector of the forest, enraged from 
the destruction, commanded a small army of forest creatures in retaliation. The 
ensuing skirmish was short, sharp, and bloody; casualties ran high on both 
sides, and the battle ended at a draw. Tensions are now high in both camps, 
with the derro and goblins sworn to revenge, and the dryad and forest 
inhabitants out for vengeance for the felling of their trees.

MONSTERS AND NPCS:

M1) Animals

A variety of different forest beasts. Types include black bear, rabbit, deer,
boar, wolf, owl, and rat. The boars carry Neurotico shrooms. Rats carry a 
random amount of coins.

M2) Frightened bandit

A flavor mob. His partner was apparently killed by the spirit of the torturer,
and so he stands guard over his dead body, attacking anyone on sight. The
torturer will attack him if he happens to follow players into the room.

M3) Birch guard

This guard monster prevents players from reaching Cichele until it is slain.

M4) Brant

The overseer of the lumberjacks. His weapon is a quest item for Cichele, and
Cichele carries a quest item for him. Prevents players from searching his 
desk while present in the room. Rewards players for killing treants. There is
a chance that his quest weapon won't spawn. Has a "fighter 3" kit for Strike
and etc.

M5) Carrion crawler

A flavor mob, imported from Vaerlon's sewers. 

M6) Cellaria

The legendary elf mage spoken of in the description of the area. Unfortunately
she has died. However, her spirit lingers on. She wants to complete her 
research before leaving for the Nether Plane. If players can find her catalyst
ring which she lost, she will give them a teleport ring in return, and then
disappear for the rest of the boot. While she is present, she warns players
when they attempt to search for potions in her room. Cellaria is level 50, but
since she is in a safe room anyway it doesn't matter.

M7) Cichele

The dryad spirit, protector of the forest. Hates Brant and his goblins with
a passion. Although she cannot reward players in any tangible way for killing
goblins, she will reward them for defeating Brant with a pair of water walking
boots. Occasionally she will spawn with some interesting weapons, too. Usually
spawns as a mage, though, who has Call Lightning, Mana Blast, and Storm of Ice.

M8) Dragonfly

A nasty little creature with poisonous natural weapons and a special hit that
infects players with a strong (for its level, anyway) poison. It can be found
when searching in the first room of the area. In some ways it is a test of a
player's readiness for the area: if the dragonfly is too much of an opponent, 
they will not last against much else in the area either. Except maybe the wild
rabbits or whatever. It is aggressive and follows quickly and far.

M9) Giliwyr

A fallen priest of Magic who is in a hidden room. Players must beat the 
Syntax Demon(tm) to find the secret exit, and it is likely that he will 
remain a secret for quite some time. As fitting a priest of Magic, he can cast
Ball of Magic and Haste. There is not much reward to beating
him, even though he has good equipment, because when he dies all his inventory
is destroyed. Instead, he leaves behind a Blade of the Magi (see items). Has a
stunning special_hit.

M10) Goblin sentinel

Guards Brant's room and won't let anyone pass while she lives. Has a special
hit that deals double damage.

M11) Goblins

The lumberjacks. There are four levels of them: Puny, Tired, Large, and Burly.
Difficulty and level increases with type. The puny ones are casters, with 
Wind of Fire and Dart of Fire.

M12) Skinny goblin

This goblin has gone mad from hunger and is busily devouring all of the
lumberjacks' food supplies. He is stronger than the rest of them and spawns
with a random fine steel axe. In his inventory he carries a bunch of breads,
and he will also occasionally throw bread at opponents in battle.

M13) Sturgeon

In a semi-hidden room, a wild and angry sturgeon can be encountered when 
players examine the water. It is a dangerous opponent, perhaps the strongest
of anything in the area, but players are given a good warning to stay away. If
players leave the room by the time he attempts to spawn, he won't come again
until the room resets. His skin is iron, with the possibility to give additional
protection for items made of it. This is to go along with the fact that he also
has 150 natural AC.

M14) Tekalu

This chitine ranger is moderately well hidden. He fights with four swords and 
uses Whirling Blades. His swords are Falcon's Falchions (see items), so they
deal sonic damage in addition to being of material crystal. He has Weapon
Parry at 75% and defends fairly well in addition to being a good attacker;
and in addition to that, his room is high above the ground; he will randomly
push people off, so they fall and take damage.

M15) Icy spirit of the torturer

Cellaria's house used to be inhabited by a master torturer who worked for 
Graemor (or so they say). He was the final inquisitor for many an innocent
Vaerlonian. Cellaria killed him when he wouldn't sell her his house, but his
spirit remains entombed below the house in a small dungeon. He wields two 
Sapphire-studded Longswords (see items) which can freeze opponents. When killed,
he leaves a hint about what the key is for the area. His swords cannot be 
obtained (currently?) as they are too powerful; they disappear when he dies.

M16) Treants

The living trees which inhabited this forest peacefully before Brant and his
goblins arrived. There are four types, in increasing order of difficulty:
Fir, Elm, Yew, and Oak. Oak treants won't move, but the rest do. Treants 
protect each other, and will attack goblins on sight. They are also all 
-Ranger rep.

M17) Vulture

Generic flavor mob. Likes to hang out with the Carrion crawler and eat corpeses.

ITEMS AND EQUIPMENT:

I1) Amber Leaf

This equipment is obtained by inserting two Golden Leaves into the Amber Stone.
It goes on the miscellaneous slot, fits anyone without needing to be resized,
and emits a lot of light.

I2) Basin

A magical spring found in one room of the forest. Its water is twice as "good"
as that from a public fountain. Its description and the sounds for the room
speak of how it is magical in nature, hinting to players that that room has
a hidden exit to 'somewhere'.

I3) Blade of the Magi

A fine steel longsword of crap quality that deals 100% magical damage. 
Giliwyr "becomes" this when he dies. It is a castable weapon and also gives
+5 to skill Cast Magical.

I4) Bark boots (water-walking)

This is the quest reward that Cichele hands out. It is a pair of +2hpr boots.
When they are worn it makes the player float above water, much like the Floating
spell. However, the effect stops working when the item's magical energy is
about half gone (or "subtle glow") - at this point, when they are worn, nothing
happens. When the boots are removed, float status is removed also.

I5) Branch from a treant

This trophy is dropped by all treants. Giving them to Brant will make him
reward the player with some gold coins. Otherwise they have little value.

I6) Brass Rapier of Nature

This is one of Cichele's weapons which she might spawn with, when she is 
not a mage type. It gives a bonus to max health and deals lightning damage. It
also has a special hit that stuns the opponent. 

I7) Rotten wood staff

This is Cichele's other weapon which she might spawn with. It has a variety
of magical properties, including poison damage, but since it's wood it is 
rather crap anyway. It has a special hit that poisons the opponent and is 
somewhat powerful.

I8) An ominous bottle <eerie glow> ("death bottles")

This potion is not a real potion, instead it is a food item. It is used by
eating it...but, woe to the player who does that, because it causes a random
potentially lethal effect such as poison. These effects last a long time and 
will probably kill most players, but at least the fire_ob can be removed by use 
of the 'roll' command. The item can also be thrown to put the effect on an 
enemy. Bottles are found by searching inside Cellaria's house.

I9) Falcon's Falchion (x4)

This is a crystal falchion. It deals part sonic damage, but this is achieved 
through changing the damagetype map directly; this avoids giving the item a
"glow". The purpose is to prevent it from giving a million divine favors and
being worth a stupid amount at the shop. Tekalu spawns with 4 of these.

I10) Sealed glass bottle, containing flames ("fire bottle")

This item, when broken, produces a campfire to the room. It will work anywhere,
but if the place would not normally allow campfires (water rooms, etc) then
the fire will still die out. Like the "death bottles" it's not a real potion;
one can't drink it and there is no effect of throwing. Bottles are found by
searching inside of Cellaria's house. 

I11) Beautiful flowers

These can be picked in a certain room of the forest. When sniffed, they randomly
restore some hp, sp, ep, or psp. Inserting 25 of these into the Amber Stone
produces a Flower Necklace. This item doesn't keep over boot.

I12) freeze_shadow.c

This is the effect shadow for Sapphire-studded Longsword. It causes frozen
status, block_attack, immobility, and silence. However, for some reason
players can still dodge attacks and do some other things while it is in effect,
so it's not perfect.

I13) Forester's Axe

This is Brant's weapon, and also a quest item for Cichele. It has +2 strength,
but is made of brass. The special hit randomly deals 3 times damage to monsters
of the Treant race.

I14) Sapphire-studded Longsword (x2)

The icy spirit of the torturer spawns with two of these. THEY ARE NOT OBTAINABLE
BY PLAYERS; when he dies they are destructed. A good thing, too, because they
are made of iceron, have a quality of 65, randomly freeze opponents, give 5 
resist to cold and fire, and also deal 75% cold damage. This was originally just
a concept weapon for another area, but I borrowed it and put it in here.

I15) Golden leaf

Cichele always spawns with one of these. Besides being worth some fair amount
of money, it is a quest item for Brant. Inserting two of these into the Amber
Stone produces an Amber Leaf. Since Cichele's room does not reset, only one of
these can be obtained per boot.

I16) Silver Mace of Leech

This is a silver mace with a quality of 40 and 3 acid damage. Brant awards this
to players when they give him Cichele's Golden leaf. The mace has a special 
that heals players for the amount of damage they dealt, unless the target is 
another player. If the target is undead, then it actually damages the wielder 
and heals the undead.

I17) Flower necklace

This is obtained by inserting 25 Beautiful flowers into the Amber Stone. It is
a miscellaneous armour which randomly boosts regenerations - hpr, spr, epr, or
pspr - by +1 or +2. To compensate for this, the item randomly changes its magic
at least every 30 seconds, so one can never be sure what regen properties it
has. Although these are easy to get, they are not very valuable, since they
are made of stone.

I18) Old ring

This is the magical catalyst that Cellaria is searching for. It is buried in a
hole in the dungeon's storage room, and that room is locked by a door whose key
is the Fine crystal stiletto. So, some thinking and ingenuity are required to
get this item. When given to Cellaria, she will make it into a Teleport Ring.
Other than this it is a worthless item.

I19) Miniscule glass bottle with something whirling inside ("regen bottle")

This is a very cool item that contains a pseudo Sorcerer's regen vortex. The
vortex is put into the room when players break the bottle. Like the other 
bottles, this is not a true potion; in fact it is really just a container to
hold the vortex with. Bottles are found by searching inside Cellaria's house.

I20) A rotten key, covered in mold

This is the key to the storehouse of the goblin lumberbacks, where the Skinny
goblin is devouring the supplies. It can be found be searching the stream in
a certain room. Keeps over the boot and the room it can be found in resets 
anyway, so it's not hard to get.

I21) A weird bottle, made of tree bark ("sleep bottle")

The fourth and final type of bottle. Like the others, it is not a true potion;
it is a food item, and players eat it to use it. When ingested it puts the 
player to sleep, no matter how tired they were before. The exception is for 
Monks, since they don't sleep or something like that. Bottles are found by
searching Cellaria's room. This item doesn't cause sleep effect when thrown
(and battle would make monsters wake up anyway).

I22) A large stone of amber, carved to resemble a massive tree

This item does not actually do anything by itself, but players can 'insert' the
Beautiful flowers and Golden leaves into it, to produce Flower necklaces and 
Amber Leaves, respectively. It spawns in the same room as Cichele, so players
would at least have to fight the Birch Guard to get to it. Can't be moved.

I23) Fine crystal stiletto

Other than being a crystal shortsword with quality of 70, this item is actually
a key for a certain door. This fact is not at all obvious, unless one happens
to discover that it has "key" among its ids. There are some hints around the
area that this is the key for that door; but still, it would take some thinking
to discover the fact. This in addition to the fact that the item is found by
searching Brant's room, which does not reset, and that can only be done once
Brant himself is dead.

I24) Golden Ring of Teleportation

This ring is given to players by Cellaria once they return the Old ring to her.
When it is used, players are teleported to the central square of their 
hometown. It has a finite number of charges, though. Doesn't work during combat.

I25) A small vortex of energies

This is the regen ob contained inside the "regen bottles". It was 99% coded
by Zaltaiz. It functions a lot like a Sorcerer's regen vortex: it goes away
in the presence of a campfire, and only one vortex can be in a room at once.
Since this is created without casting a spell, the power of the vortex is
based on the level of the one who breaks the "regen bottle".

I26) Pile of dirty coins

This is a kludge object that is held by the rat version of the animals monster.
Because animals cannot directly have money, it instead spawns with this item
in its inventory. When players 'polish' the coins they reveal what type they
are and receive the appropriate amount of money to their inventory.
