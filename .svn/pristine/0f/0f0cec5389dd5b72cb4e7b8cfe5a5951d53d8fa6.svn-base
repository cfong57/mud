Puuh, done with the QC. The whole area is a big disappointment. The whole area
is just a big shooting range for low level players filled with identical descs
and only few different kind of mobs. Didn't even bother to check typos.

This area will not get game without some major changes. At least these need to 
be done in addition to all what is said below in MOBS/OBJS/QUESTS/ROOMS:
 - Room layout needs to be changed. It is too symmetric and similar.
 - All rooms need to have different descs
 - Amount of mobs needs to be severely reduced and more interesting mobs
   are needed
 - More content into the area. Basically now it's just army of non-agro mobs 
   (players can just walk around, get the key, unlock the door, blast king
    return the heart and quest is done, voila. no sweat for even the dummest
    players and very low level players can kill these mobs and get huge 
    rewards) in a boring rooms.
 - Serious downtuning here and there
 - Change all paths to start with /u/blablabla instead of u/blablabala.

MOBS
Remove the A/An from the beginging of short descs and descs in lower case 
unless the start with a name. Bodyparts are fucked up in some mobs. Those 
second numbers after the bodypart need to add up to 100 or something WILL bug.
You also need to add some random to movement speed of mobs.

bluefire_bat.c:
Remove the \n's from the start of messages. Short desc is a bit too plain.
The idea of this mob on the other hand is superb. Also the skin bonuses 
are TOO good. Lose some of them or make a switch that randomly gives one 
of them. -100 fire resistance is horrible. 

gel.c & gslime.c:
Remove the \n's from the start of messages and the short desc needs some 
work.

ghost.c:
Remove "The" from the start of short desc. 

hellbat.c:
Everything that was in bluefire_bat.c is true in here also but there's even
a bigger problem here, the refence to hell in the name. There's no hell in 
Icesus so basically there can't be hellbats either. Something needs to be 
done for that fact :)

kslime.c:
This slime is way too easy for the breastplate and for the quest reward. 
Remove the \n's from the start of messages. This mob needs serious uptune.

murin.c:
This mob is a mess. The level is WAY too high and the eqs are absolutely
too good for anything. Lower the level a lot, do something to the eqs and
there is no ranger combat kit. Combat kit 5 is too high anyway.

oslime.c:
Remove the \n's from the start of messages.

shade_r.c:
Short desc is really boring, it definitely needs some more work.
And why is there ! in the agrochance and set_speed?

shade_s.c:
Short desc is a bit boring. Also all of that stuff what he has 
adds up to over 15k in money and the mob itself is only 12k.


OBJS
Remove the A/An from the beginging of short descs and the descs
should be in lowercase.

acidaxe.c & acidrapier.c & acidsword.c:
Why is long desc in a single line?

dagger.c:
Long desc should be longer.

kingbplate.c:
Why is long desc in a single line?

knife.c:
Long desc needs some work.

murinboots.c & murinclothes.c & muringloves.c & murinshirt.c &
murinthights.c:
You got to be kidding me with these eqs. Short descs are a bit boring
but the real problem is that these eqs are THE BEST EQS in game.
Quality needs to be lowered seriously to somewhere around 20-30.
Magical stats are way too good. Even lowered to 1/1/1 and chitinium
silk is too good too.

scimitar.c & scimitar2.c:
These need to have different descs and their magical stats are way
too good. Also fine steel seems a bit too good with that quality.

shashadegauntlets.c & shadehelmet.c:
Require a lot longer long desc and different kind. Currently all of
these have basicly the same desc.

QUESTS
help_alchemist_ghost.c:
query_info() bugs. And why the two blank lines? You need to use \n if
you want to have that space between those two blocks.

ROOMS
Rooms are boring, they don't have anything in them except the pool 
searches which aren't that interesting. Identical room descs need to be
changed as the whole area consist only identical descs.

barren_clearing.c:
Remove set_signs, we don't do things like this. This is Batmud(tm) way.
\n is missing from the end of the long desc. Add exit to out world from 
here.

b2w.c:
Do something to "(right/left)" in descs here and other rooms.

down_in_a_hole.c:
You don't need to put descs separately if they are same. You can use
({ "slime", "trails", "slugs", "ooze" }) instead of putting them separately.

outworld.c:
This rooms is useless. Just add the exit from barren_clearing.c to 
outworld.

secret.c:
Crest is a bit boring as it serves really no purpose and it cannot even be 
examined in anyway. Better remove it totally.

t_inter_2.c:
No adamantium doors.

Allanon replies:
-Almost all rooms scrapped. Remaking new area layout.
-Fixed all abovementioned problems.
